**Operating rules**
- The repository should be kept private for now. This is because the code contains paid assets or is not completely safe from a security standpoint.
- Mimichan is the main developer, with support from wwmonkey. Other members should never edit or push the code.
- We have a template for creating issues, so please use it. Please fill in all the fields of the template if possible, but for the time being, it is acceptable to leave some fields blank.
- Please write your issue in as much detail as possible and in an easy-to-understand manner. Card names should always include the card ID or card set ID. Please use words that are common or officially used, and avoid slang as much as possible.
- The created issue will be viewable in Project, and Mimichan will be in charge of moving the status of the issue. Mimichan will close issues that are deemed resolved in the development environment. Bugs and requests with a status of "Done" have already been resolved and fixed in the latest version.
- Discussion of individual bugs and feature requests should be done in issue comments. This way it will be easier to keep a log and check. Other topics will be discussed in Discord chat.
- If you find that a bug that should have been fixed has not yet been resolved, please reopen the closed issue and add a comment to the issue to that effect.
